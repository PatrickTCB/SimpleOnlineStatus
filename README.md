# SimpleOnlineStatus
A simple android app that tells you whether you're online or not.

This is a bare bones app with one screen and one button. It tells you whether your OS thinks you're online or not. 
If it thinks you are, the app will call the https://www.ipify.org/ API to get your IP address.
In addition to telling you something useful, hopefully, it's a second check to see if you're really online.
